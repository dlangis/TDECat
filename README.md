This is a supplementary repository for the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) catalogue (TDECat hereafter) presented in Langis et al. 2025 (in preperation).
We have collected publicly available multi-wavelength photometry and optical spectroscopy.
TDECat can either be accessed by the different repository sections (read below for more details) or by the app (App section).
Below we outline the structure of this repository, as well as a quick overview of each section.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

Section 1: Main TDE Catalogue

In this section we present the TDECat sources, along with their coordinates and other information, through the TDECat.csv file.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

Section 2: Photometry

This section is split into 3 subsections: Optical and Infrared, UVOT and X-ray. 
i) In the Optical and Infrared subsection we include all the publicly available photometry, collected using the Black Hole Target Observation Manager (BHTom; https://bh-tom2.astrolabs.pl) and the ASAS-SN Sky Patrol V2.0 (http://asas-sn.ifa.hawaii.edu/skypatrol/: Hart et al 2023; Shappee et al 2014). 
ii) In the UVOT subsection we present the data collected through the Swift Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) (Roming et al. 2005).
iii) In the X-ray subsection we present the available data for our main catalogue sample in the archives of Swift, Chandra and XMM-Newton missions. In addition to data available from observations of Swift-XRT, Chanra-ACIS and XMM-Newton-EPIC, we looked for X-ray counterparts to TDE sources in the 13th data release of the fourth XMM-Newton serendipitous source catalogue (4XMM-DR13, Webb et al. 2020) and eROSITA main catalogue (eRASS1, Merloni et al. 2024). More information about the data reduction process can be found in Appendix B of Langis et al. 2025.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

Section 3: Spectroscopy

The optical spectra we have included in this section were all taken from either the available spectra on the Transient Name Server (TNS; https://www.wis-tns.org/) or from the Weizmann Interactive Supernova Data Repository (WISeREP; https://www.wiserep.org/; Yaron & Gal-Yam 2012). For some TDEs the spectra are available in past studies that are referenced in Sect. 3.4 of Langis et al. 2025.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

Section 4: App

We present a python app that runs locally, displaying the information included in TDECat.csv. It also plots the different waveband light curves and spectra for the TDEs in the sample. For more information on how to operate it, select the App section and read README_APP.txt.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

Section 5: Honorable Mentions

In the section we present TDE candidates have strong indications of being TDEs, however another event class (e.g. AGN, SN) cannot be excluded or there are no available spectra from the time of the flare. These sources are included in .csv file named honorable_mentions.csv.
